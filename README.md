# Cursor Lock for Browser Games  

A lightweight **AutoIt** tool that **confines the mouse cursor** to a game window inside a browser. This prevents accidental movement outside the game while allowing full control inside the client area. It will also prevent the dropdown X from displaying at the top of the screen.  

## Features  
✅ 🔒 **Locks the cursor inside the game window**  
✅ 🎮 **Automatically detects browser-based games**  
✅ 🔄 **Toggle cursor lock/unlock with a hotkey**  
✅ 🖥️ **Handles window borders & DPI scaling correctly**   

## Requirements  
- Windows 7 / 10 / 11
- AutoIt (for running the script directly)
