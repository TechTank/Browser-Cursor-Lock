# Browser Cursor Lock
A lightweight **AutoIt** tool that **confines the mouse cursor** to a game window inside a browser. This prevents accidental movement outside the game while allowing full control inside the client area. It will also prevent the dropdown X from displaying at the top of the screen, allowing you to keep full control over your games.

## Features  
✅ 🎮 **Automatically detects your browser-based games**   
✅ 🔄 **Toggle cursor lock/unlock with a hotkey**   
✅ 🔒 **Locks the cursor inside the game window**   
✅ 🖥️ **Customizable browser and game settings**   

## Requirements
- Windows 7 / 10 / 11
- AutoIt (for running the script directly)
